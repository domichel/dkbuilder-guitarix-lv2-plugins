# dkbuilder guitarix-LV2 plugins

## Place for audio guitarix and LV2 plugins made with dkbuilder

dkbuilder is a toolkit that takes gschem electronic schematics as input and output source code in different formats:
LV2 (native linux audio plugins), guitarix or faust. 
The dkbuilder is part of guitarix source code, see https://linuxmusicians.com/search.php?keywords=dkbuilder for reference on how to install and use it, and https://github.com/brummer10/guitarix for its code.

The LV2 plugins can be used with any LV2 capable host (guitarix, jalv, ardour, ...), the faust code will be best used with XUiDesigner:

## The plugins are organised into 2 main directories:

- main: for plugins that works as wanted
- wip: for plugins in progress
